# Karigor AI

The first AI-native platform for Bangladeshi SMBs to automate support, centralize communications, and save thousands of work hours. Karigor AI helps businesses handle customer inquiries across multiple channels, providing 24/7 intelligent support while reducing manual workload and missed sales opportunities.

## ✨ Features

- 💬 **AI-Powered Unified Inbox** – A smart hub that organizes all conversations from Facebook, WhatsApp, and other channels. The AI suggests replies and highlights urgent messages, helping you focus on what matters most.

- 🤖 **24/7 AI Assistant** – An AI that never sleeps, never takes a vacation, and never makes mistakes. Train it once with your business information, and it handles up to 80% of customer queries instantly, saving countless hours and salary costs.

- 📊 **Intelligent CRM** – Automatically creates a profile for every customer who contacts you, tracking their entire conversation history. Provides context to deliver amazing, personalized service every time.

- 🔄 **Intelligent Human Handover** – The AI is smart enough to know what it doesn't know. For complex questions or situations requiring human touch, it automatically and seamlessly transfers conversations to human agents, ensuring customers never get stuck.

- 💡 **AI-Powered Reply Suggestions** – When humans take over, the AI acts as a smart assistant, suggesting the best replies based on your knowledge base and past conversations. Empowers teams to be faster, more accurate, and more consistent.

- 🇧🇩 **AI Trained for Bangladesh** – Specially trained on local language patterns to understand English, Bengali, and "Banglish" (mixed language). This means more accurate answers and happier customers, unlike generic bots that struggle with local dialects.
